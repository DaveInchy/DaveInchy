# I ðŸ’– React + Tailwind + Typescript
```react im not that good at.. but its an amazing techinacal marvel.
therefor check out my overwolf app template, or a react native desktop template or any other templates to get started with Cross platform app development!

I mostly use tailwind with postcss to configure it together with webpack...
I KNOW WEBPACK IS NOT THE ALPHA NOMORE but leave me to my work, and you might be amazed
